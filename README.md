# Emulate PinePhone with Unicorn Emulator

_Can we emulate Arm64 PinePhone with [Unicorn Emulator](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/)?_

Let's find out! We'll call the [Unicorn Emulator](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) in Rust (instead of C)...

(I'm too old to write meticulous C... But I'm OK to get nagged by Rust Compiler if I miss something!)

# Emulate Arm64 Machine Code

![Emulate Arm64 Machine Code](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/unicorn-code.png)

Suppose we wish to emulate some Arm64 Machine Code...

https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/bc5643dea66c70f57a150955a12884f695acf1a4/src/main.rs#L7-L8

Here's our Rust Program that calls Unicorn Emulator to emulate the Arm64 Machine Code...

https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/bc5643dea66c70f57a150955a12884f695acf1a4/src/main.rs#L1-L55

We add `unicorn-engine` to [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml)...

https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/bc5643dea66c70f57a150955a12884f695acf1a4/Cargo.toml#L8-L9

And we run our Rust Program...

```text
→ cargo run --verbose
  Fresh cc v1.0.79
  Fresh cmake v0.1.49
  Fresh pkg-config v0.3.26
  Fresh bitflags v1.3.2
  Fresh libc v0.2.139
  Fresh unicorn-engine v2.0.1
  Fresh pinephone-emulator v0.1.0
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
  Running `target/debug/pinephone-emulator`
```

Our Rust Program works OK for emulating Arm64 Memory and Arm64 Registers.

Let's try something interesting: Unicorn Hooks...

# Memory Access Hook for Arm64 Emulation

Unicorn Emulator lets us attach hooks to Emulate Memory Access.

Here's a Hook Function for Memory Access...

https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L83-L95

Our Hook Function prints all Read / Write Access to Emulated Arm64 Memory.

This is how we attach the Hook Function to the Unicorn Emulator...

https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L59-L74

When we run this, we'll see the Read and Write Memory Accesses made by our [Emulated Arm64 Code](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/bc5643dea66c70f57a150955a12884f695acf1a4/src/main.rs#L7-L8)...

```text
hook_memory: 
  mem_type=WRITE, 
  address=0x10008, 
  size=4, 
  value=0x12345678

hook_memory: 
  mem_type=READ, 
  address=0x10008, 
  size=1, 
  value=0x0
```

This will be useful when we emulate Memory-Mapped Input/Output on PinePhone.

(Like for the Allwinner A64 UART Controller)

Unicorn Emulator allows Code Execution Hooks too...
